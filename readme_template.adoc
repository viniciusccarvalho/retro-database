= Retro database project

Database files based on the https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database[libreto-database].

The libretro project contains a database of several rom files from different sources such as a https://no-intro.org/[no-intro]. Those dat files
however are sometimes on a particular format that is not easy to parse.

I wrote a small ANTLR based parser https://github.com/viniciusccarvalho/libretro-dat-parser[libretro-dat-parser] to parse those files and export them as a csv file.


= Supported files and platforms

Inside the `data` folder there's a main `roms.csv` file that contains all the parsed roms from the several dat files. The table bellow shows what files (and checksums)
that are included in the latest release of the data file.
